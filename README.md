# PX4-TrustZone
The **PX4-TrustZone** project proposes an architecture that can protect core-assets of the drone system, such as private key, user data, and security functions, by utilizing the ARM TrustZone function. üöÅüîê

## ARM TrustZone
**ARM TrustZone** was introduced to protect key assets of the system such as private keys, user data, and security functions from unauthorized external access. **ARM TrustZone** is a mechanism that guarantees the separation of the execution environment by dividing memory, peripheral devices, and functions into secure and non-secure areas. ARMv8-M is a processor model that can utilize **ARM TrustZone** function based on ARM Cortex-M series(M23, M33, M35P, M55). ARMv8-M provides secure functions such as TEE(Trusted Execution Environment), Secure Key Storage, Secure Firmware Update, and Crypto Accelerator.

### Secure State
**Secure State** is a TEE that can protect from unauthorized external access by using the ARM TrustZone technique. Components of **Secure State** include Trusted Firmware, S-Driver, Flight Control IDS, PSA Services, and PSA Development API.
- **Trusted Firmware**: Trusted Firmware provides a software package to build a TEE. Trusted Firmware is the basis for utilizing the ARM TrustZone function.
- **S-Drivers**: S-Drivers conducts a main role in the drone system. S-Drivers operate in a TEE.
- **PSA Services**: PSA Services are security function that can be applied to the drone system. Functions provided by PSA Services include Key Management, Cryptography, Secure Boot, Secure Storage, Secure Firmware Update, and Attestation.
- **Flight Control IDS**: Logs are monitored to detect intrusions. It notifies the user when the log is different from the normal case.
- **PSA Development API**: PSA Development API allows applications in the Non-Secure State to access assets in the Secure State.

### Non-Secure State
**Non-Secure State** is a REE(Rich Execution Environment) in which drone applications, middleware, operating systems, and drivers operate. Components of **Non-Secure State** include NS-Driver, RTOS, Middleware, and Flight Control.  
- **NS-Drivers**: NS-Drivers conducts a auxiliary role in the drone system. NS-Drivers operate in a REE.
- **RTOS**: An operating system focused on real-time application management. NuttX does this role in PX4.
- **Middleware**: Software that acts as a request broker between RTOS and Flight Control. uORB does this role in PX4.
- **Flight Control**: It shows the main modules that control drone flight and the flow of data processed by the drone system. First, a command from the user is received from the Commander, and data is transferred in the order of Estimator, Navigator, and Controller.

### Trusted Hardware
**Trusted Hardware** is a hardware module necessary to utilize the security functions provided by Secure State. Components of **Trusted Hardware** include High-Entropy RNG, Crypto Accelerator, and OTP Memory.
- **High-Entropy RNG**: High-Entropy RNG(Random Number Generator) generates random numbers with high entropy as hardware. Random numbers are used in the encryption process and have higher reliability than PRNG(Pseudo RNG).
- **Crypto Accelerator**: Crypto Accelerator is hardware that performs key generation, encryption, and decryption, and supports various encryption algorithms such as AES, ECDSA, RSA, and SHA. Crypto Accelerator can encrypt and store data in Secure Flash for data confidentiality.
- **OTP Memory**: OTP(One Time Programmable) memory is non-volatile and cannot be rewritten. Provisioned Data was provided when manufacturing SoC devices, Device Unique Key is used in the encryption process.
